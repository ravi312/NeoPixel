# Make your own Gaming Station!

In an era where touchscreen-based smartphones are ubiquitous, there was a time when people used to play games like Tetris and Snake in regular mobile handsets. Wonâ€™t it be interesting to redesign some of those retro-games by making your own screen with just LEDs and play along with your peers?
This is going be a very interesting challenge to anyone who wants to brush up/learn the basic concepts of programming along with side tinkering with microcontroller!

So, here is the challenge!

Your task would be to make a DIY gaming station using array of neopixel LEDs (link below) and write the program to for the following games:
Snake
In this game, the tail of the snake grows by one unit on eating the food. The game gets over once the snakehead touches its own body. The food gets randomly generated and the playing ground is permeable ie. on reaching the top, the head generates from the bottom.

The gaming station can enable one to pick up electronics, programming, and fundamentals of physics in an engaging and meaningful manner.
